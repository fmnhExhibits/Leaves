      We are looking through a microscope at a section of the underside of a plant.
      The rounded bulges, representing sac-like objects growing from either side are actually tiny modified leaves!
      Measuring the length and width of these modified leaves (microleaves) can tell us what kind of plant we have.
      Let's start by marking the length of the first microleaf.
